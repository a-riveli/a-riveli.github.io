If you select Yearly Premium, your subscription will automatically renew as a rolling subscription at the end of each annual period, on the date on which your Yearly Premium was activated (each being a “Renewal”). If you proceed with a Renewal, the method of payment used to pay the fees will be debited at the end of your current Premium subscription.

Lifetime Premium subscription constitutes 100 years or until the date Ihsan Yalcinkaya ceases to commercially offer the Services for Paris: Audio Guide.</p>
